"Artificial Lift - ""Amph-3"" Sand
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"The WC 56 Well No. A-10 was originally completed in November 2000 in the ""Amph-3"" Sand with existing perforations of 6,586'-6,591' MD. A vent screen completion was installed after the well sanded up and the well is currently producing via insert gas lift. The source gas is expected to run out in the near future with no potential for other gas.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, approval is requested per the filing of this APM to utilize an HWO unit to install an electric submersible pump (ESP) to artificially lift the well to allow production to continue from the current ""Amph-3"" Sand completion.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"Seals will be pulled from the packer at 6200' MD and the hole circulated with filtered and treated sea water. An isolation assembly with a packer will be run to 6050' MD to isolate old squeeze perforations at 6084'-6093' MD. To conclude proposed operations, the ESP will be run  below a packer set at 5800' MD with an SCSSV above the packer.
