Operation Description:,,,,,,,,,
Procedural Narrative:,,,,,,,,,
"Objective:	
",,,,,,,,,
"The well has sustained pressure of 980 psi on the annulus between 7"" casing X 2-3/8"" tubing. Efforts to reduce the pressure have been unsuccessful. This procedure consists of the following:
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"   •	Set a retrievable plug inside the tubing below the production packer
",,,,,,,,,
"   •	Run a tubing caliper log to determine the source of the communication
",,,,,,,,,
"   •	Leave the retrievable plug inside the tubing and the well shut in until the next course of action is determined on this well
",,,,,,,,,

"Reservoir Properties:
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"1.	""D-2"" Sand
",,,,,,,,,
"   •	Perforations 9,236'- 9,249'MD (9,236'- 9,249'TVD)
",,,,,,,,,
"   •	BHP= 1,600 psi (estimated)
",,,,,,,,,
"   •	BHT= 188°F
",,,,,,,,,
"   •	SITP (01/23/08)= 1,500psi

"Proposed Procedure:
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"1. Mobilize lift boat to location
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"2. RU slickline unit and lubricator. Tree connection is 2-7/8"" GrayLok. Test lubricator to 2,000 psi.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"3. MU & GIH with 1.86""- 2"" gage ring to the Macco Lock @ 269'. 
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"4. PU and retrieve the MACCO PB Valve (serial# 832182) @ 269. 
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"5. LD inspect and redress valve.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"6. MU & GIH with 1.84"" gage ring down to 9,200'md. Note any difficulties in reaching this depth. POOH.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"7. MU & with a collar stop for 2-3/8"", 4.7 ppf tubing (min ID= 1.875"").
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"8. Locate into collar at 9,200'+/- and set same. POOH.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"9. PU & GIH with a ""PS"" plug and set same in collar stop.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"10. POOH. Bleed SITP down to 500 psi and monitor tubing and casing for 
",,,,,,,,,
"indications of pressure increases.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"11. MU & GIH with a tubing caliper log. Log 2-3/8"" tubing from the top of 
",,,,,,,,,
"the ""PS"" plug at 9,200' to the surface.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"12. Once caliper log has been run, then re-run MACCO PB Valve to 269'.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"13. RD slickline unit and lubricator.
",,,,,,,,,
"
",,,,,,,,,
"14. Leave ""PS"" plug in tubing and well shut in.
