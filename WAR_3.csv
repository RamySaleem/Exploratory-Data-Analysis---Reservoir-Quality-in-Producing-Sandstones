Note: The outer gas bleed valve (a fail safe close valve) failed to close under hydraulic pressure when controlled by the blue pod. ENI office, BSEE, and Lloyds Registry were notified. On 06/14/2014 @ 7:53PM, Tom Meyer BSEE NOLA District gave written approval for continued operation of the BOP via the yellow pod, as it will provide for complete functionality of both inner and outer gas bleed valves. Drilling operations may continue as planned.",,,,,,,,,,,,
