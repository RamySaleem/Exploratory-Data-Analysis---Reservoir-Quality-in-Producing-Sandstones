# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## Reservoir-Quality-in-Producing-Sandstones
This project will explore, analyse and visualise publicly available wells datasets from the United States offshore data centre, the USGS boreholes website - Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) https://www.data.bsee.gov/Main/Default.aspx with a particular focus on the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) wells. This project will study sandstones quality as a reservoir, the production history of the operators on the Gulf of Mexico and a well summary report to highlight any possible problem. The reservoir quality analysis will examine relationships between average values of porosity, permeability, depth, temperature, pressure, thickness, age, and play type for data files from 2009 until 2019.The porosity plotted and shown in a wide range of plots as a function of permeability and burial depth. Also, the median (P50) porosity will be plotted against depth to examine the porosity trend. Moreover, this project will investigate the companies oil and gas production in the gulf of Mexico for the last five years. Lastly, the analysis will include an investigation of well summary reports of five wells. The project will include web scrapping to collect online well summary reports to generate a word cloud. The project results can be useful for specifying realistic distributions of parameters for both exploration risk evaluation and/or reservoir modelling by machine learning algorithms in the next project. 

• Collected & merged 100,000+ rows of Sandstone reservoirs data files dataset using the Pandas library.

• Analysed & Visualised sandstone reservoir dataset using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly & Folium libraries

• Discovered insights about reservoir porosity & permeability, well operation problems and production performance

The work contained in this repositories contains work conducted during a PhD study undertaken as part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Oil & Gas funded 50% through its National Productivity Investment Fund grant number NE/R01051X/1 and 50% by the University of Aberdeen through its PhD Scholarship Scheme. The support of both organisations is gratefully acknowledged. The work is reliant on Open-Source Python Libraries, particularly numpy, matplotlib, plotly and pandas and contributors to these are thanked, along with Jovian and GitHub for open access hosting of the Python scripts for the study.
